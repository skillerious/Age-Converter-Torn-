## üìú Overview
The **Age Converter** is a lightweight userscript designed for Torn.com players. It converts the in-game account age (displayed in days) into a more user-friendly format of years, months, and days. The converted age is displayed elegantly beneath the existing age box, giving you a clearer picture of how long your Torn account has been active. 

This script requires a **Public Access API key** from Torn to fetch your profile details and calculate the account age.

## üß© Features

- üéØ **Easy-to-read format**: Automatically converts your account age from days into years, months, and days.
- üé® **Enhanced UI**: Styled with modern fonts and shadow effects for a cleaner, visually appealing look.
- üîê **API Integration**: Utilizes Torn's **Public Access API** to fetch real-time account age data.
- üöÄ **Minimal & Efficient**: Runs automatically when you load the Torn website, requiring no extra steps beyond providing your API key.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
When you first install and load the script, it will prompt you to enter your Torn **Public API key**. This key allows the script to fetch your account‚Äôs age directly from the Torn API and display it in a more readable format beneath the in-game age counter.

1. **Age Calculation**: Converts your account age from days to years, months, and days using simple arithmetic.
2. **Display**: Shows the converted age in a sleek, blue-colored font with a shadow effect for enhanced readability.

### Example
Instead of seeing `Age: 394 days`, you'll see something like:

**394 days** ‚û°Ô∏è **1 Year, 1 Month, 29 Days**

## üìã Requirements

- **Torn Public API Key**: The script requires a Torn API key with **Public Access**. You can find or generate your API key by navigating to **Torn > Settings > API Key**.
  
  **Note**: Make sure you choose the **Public API** level, as it's sufficient for fetching profile information such as your account age.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Install a userscript manager (if you don't have one already):
    - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Recommended)
    - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
    - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

2. After installing your preferred userscript manager, click [here](https://update.greasyfork.org/scripts/506922/Age%20Converter.user.js) to install the **Age Converter** script.

3. When prompted for your Torn **Public API key**, enter it into the popup window. Your API key will be securely stored in your browser‚Äôs local storage for future use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. Once installed, the script will automatically run whenever you visit Torn.com.
2. If it's your first time using the script, you‚Äôll be prompted to enter your Torn **Public API Key**. The script will save this key in your browser‚Äôs local storage, so you don‚Äôt have to re-enter it.
3. The converted age (in years, months, and days) will appear beneath the age display box on your profile.

### Updating Your API Key
If you ever need to change your API key, simply clear the stored key by following these steps:
1. Open your browser‚Äôs developer tools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
2. Navigate to the **Application** tab.
3. Find **Local Storage** > `https://www.torn.com`.
4. Delete the `tornApiKey` entry.
5. Reload Torn.com, and the script will prompt you to enter a new API key.
